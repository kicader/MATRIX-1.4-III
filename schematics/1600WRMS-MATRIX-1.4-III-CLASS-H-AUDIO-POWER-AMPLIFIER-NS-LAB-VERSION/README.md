ABOUT
-----

MATRIX 1.4 III is platform of audio power amplifier core circuit technology
with BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor) as the base implementation. This is the
next generation (but not a fork) of the previous
[MATRIX 1.4](http://matrix14freeamp.sourceforge.net/) and
[MATRIX 1.4 II T13](http://matrix-1-4-two-t13.sourceforge.io/).

SOURCE DOWNLOAD
---------------

Development source and schematic examples of MATRIX 1.4 III can be downloaded
via GITHUB at <https://github.com/kicader/MATRIX-1.4-III/> on your personal
computer via the desktop GIT program tool or command line interface based GIT
tool:

    git clone https://github.com/kicader/MATRIX-1.4-III.git

The source and schematic example bundle also available as ZIP file, can be
downloaded via general web browser or file downloader tool with URL:
<https://github.com/kicader/MATRIX-1.4-III/archive/master.zip>

SCHEMATIC EXAMPLE
-----------------

The example of schematics are available within
[schematics](https://github.com/kicader/MATRIX-1.4-III/tree/master/schematics)
folder or at:  
<https://github.com/kicader/MATRIX-1.4-III/tree/master/schematics/>

The schematic files can be viewed and edited with use
[KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) V.5.x and also available in PDF format.

Schematic example packages are available with analysis simulation support for
use with [NGSPICE](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/).
The for-simulation purposed schematic files are named with `ANALYSIS` prefix.
